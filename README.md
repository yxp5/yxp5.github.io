# BACHELOR OF SCIENCE

Math & Computer Science
Grade: 3.47/4.00

#### Skills

- Applied Statistic and Data Science: applying statistical methods over real life data. Experience in regression modeling, non-parametric statistic; as well as is using SQL and R to perform data analysis.
- Artificial Intelligence: Experience in neural network, machine learning algorithm, apply optimization and heuristic, and research experience in natural language processing.
- Automated Reasoning: using formal method, mathematical modeling and proof assistant to develop efficient and valid verification programs. Elementary research experience in normalization by evaluation for the simply-typed lambda calculus (supervised by [Jason Hu](https://hustmphrrr.github.io/))

#### Softwares

Fluent in:

- **Python**: Daily usage. To swiftly implement a sudden algorithm idea. Often used for machine learning application.
- **Java**: Software design and video game modding.
- **C**: For low-level high-performance implementation. Building simple shell.
- **R**: Efficiently compute various statistical model, such as rank-based non-parametric statistic and regression models.
- **SQL**: Data retrieval and manipulation. Neatly structure and classify data while assuring easy and fast access.
- **OCaml**: Functional programming, mostly used for research purpose.
- **Coq/Beluga**: Construct mathematical models of real life systems (such as a software program or a security protocol) and reason about their properties to ensure correctness.
